# Performance modeling of vehicular cloud based on RoboTaxi fleet
## Motivation
Robotaxis are equipped with wireless telecommunication capabilities, a sensor suite that contains diverse type of sensors and a powerful onboard computation unit. It will be a subject of interest when the robotaxis of a mobility service provider can interconnect and form a computing cluser and execute external computing jobs together while serving regular hailers. Clearly, this will provide additional values to the mobility service provider. However, there remains a few questions of this system that need to be answered:
1. What are the behaviors, which include the interarrival times of the requests to the taxi system and the duration of the ride, of the current hailers?
2. Since the main objective of the system is to first serve the hailers then, during robitaxi idle time, to execute the jobs, what will be the computation throughput of the system during rush/ off-peak hours?
3. How many robotaxis are required to fulfill a certain Quality of service of both the mobility service and the computing service?
This project is aimed to answer questions similarly to the above.
## Project description
The project is splitted into 2 parts: Hailers' behavior analysis and Performance analysis of robotaxi computing system
1. Hailers' behavior analysis
    This project applies data analysis, statistical modeling to answer the first question above. Then it applies
## Summarized Findings
1. Modeling of
    Pictures with descriptions
2.
